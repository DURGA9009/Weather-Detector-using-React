It's a cool React Weather App, Where you can find the weather of your/others city. 
I was building this app using npm-styled-component and the help of open-weather API.
Weather forcasting is pretty normal application when we use perfect and accurate API.There are many different types of APIs. One of the most common types, and some of the easiest to use, are weather APIs. Weather APIs pair nicely with geolocation APIs and some actually use geolocation behind the scenes. Most give back easy to understand data that can be impressively cheap to access.
My app is going to make an HTTP call to a weather API to retrieve data whenever a user enters a city/country. Here i have used conditional logic, styling, spinners, and error handling to improve the user experience as we wait for that HTTP call to return the data.
